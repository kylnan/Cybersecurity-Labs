THE OSCARS TURN  ON SUNDAY WHICH SEEMS AcOUT RIGHT AFTER THIS LONG STRANGE
AWARDS TRIP THE cAGGER FEELS LIaE A NONAGENARIAN TOO

THE AWARDS RACE WAS cOOaENDED cY THE DEMISE OF HARlEY WEINSTEIN AT ITS OUTSET
AND THE APPARENT IMPLOSION OF HIS FILM COMPANY AT THE END AND IT WAS SHAPED cY
THE EMERGENCE OF METOO TIMES UP cLACaGOWN POLITICS ARMCANDY ACTIlISM AND
A NATIONAL CONlERSATION AS cRIEF AND MAD AS A FElER DREAM AcOUT WHETHER THERE
OUGHT TO cE A PRESIDENT WINFREY THE SEASON DIDNT uUST SEEM EhTRA LONG IT WAS
EhTRA LONG cECAUSE THE OSCARS WERE MOlED TO THE FIRST WEEaEND IN MARCH TO
AlOID CONFLICTING WITH THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS THANaS
PYEONGCHANG

ONE cIG eUESTION SURROUNDING THIS YEARS ACADEMY AWARDS IS HOW OR IF THE
CEREMONY WILL ADDRESS METOO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE GOLDEN GLOcES WHICH cECAME
A uUcILANT COMINGOUT PARTY FOR TIMES UP THE MOlEMENT SPEARHEADED cY 
POWERFUL HOLLYWOOD WOMEN WHO HELPED RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT SEhUAL
HARASSMENT AROUND THE COUNTRY

SIGNALING THEIR SUPPORT GOLDEN GLOcES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELlES IN cLACa
SPORTED LAPEL PINS AND SOUNDED OFF AcOUT SEhIST POWER IMcALANCES FROM THE RED
CARPET AND THE STAGE ON THE AIR E WAS CALLED OUT AcOUT PAY INEeUITY AFTER
ITS FORMER ANCHOR CATT SADLER eUIT ONCE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAaING FAR
LESS THAN A MALE COHOST AND DURING THE CEREMONY NATALIE PORTMAN TOOa A cLUNT
AND SATISFYING DIG AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIRECTORS HOW COULD
THAT cE TOPPED

AS IT TURNS OUT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE OSCARS IT PROcAcLY WONT cE

WOMEN INlOLlED IN TIMES UP SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE GLOcES SIGNIFIED THE
INITIATIlES LAUNCH THEY NElER INTENDED IT TO cE uUST AN AWARDS SEASON
CAMPAIGN OR ONE THAT cECAME ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH REDCARPET ACTIONS INSTEAD
A SPOaESWOMAN SAID THE GROUP IS WORaING cEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HAS SINCE
AMASSED  MILLION FOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH AFTER THE GLOcES WAS
FLOODED WITH THOUSANDS OF DONATIONS OF  OR LESS FROM PEOPLE IN SOME 
COUNTRIES


NO CALL TO WEAR cLACa GOWNS WENT OUT IN ADlANCE OF THE OSCARS THOUGH THE
MOlEMENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY cE REFERENCED cEFORE AND DURING THE CEREMONY 
ESPECIALLY SINCE lOCAL METOO SUPPORTERS LIaE ASHLEY uUDD LAURA DERN AND
NICOLE aIDMAN ARE SCHEDULED PRESENTERS

ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS SEASON NO ONE REALLY aNOWS WHO IS GOING TO WIN cEST
PICTURE ARGUAcLY THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME INARGUAcLY THE NAILcITER
NARRATIlE ONLY SERlES THE AWARDS HYPE MACHINE cUT OFTEN THE PEOPLE FORECASTING
THE RACE SOCALLED OSCAROLOGISTS CAN MAaE ONLY EDUCATED GUESSES

THE WAY THE ACADEMY TAcULATES THE cIG WINNER DOESNT HELP IN ElERY OTHER
CATEGORY THE NOMINEE WITH THE MOST lOTES WINS cUT IN THE cEST PICTURE
CATEGORY lOTERS ARE ASaED TO LIST THEIR TOP MOlIES IN PREFERENTIAL ORDER IF A
MOlIE GETS MORE THAN  PERCENT OF THE FIRSTPLACE lOTES IT WINS WHEN NO
MOlIE MANAGES THAT THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST FIRSTPLACE lOTES IS ELIMINATED AND
ITS lOTES ARE REDISTRIcUTED TO THE MOlIES THAT GARNERED THE ELIMINATED cALLOTS
SECONDPLACE lOTES AND THIS CONTINUES UNTIL A WINNER EMERGES

IT IS ALL TERRIcLY CONFUSING cUT APPARENTLY THE CONSENSUS FAlORITE COMES OUT
AHEAD IN THE END THIS MEANS THAT ENDOFSEASON AWARDS CHATTER INlARIAcLY
INlOLlES TORTURED SPECULATION AcOUT WHICH FILM WOULD MOST LIaELY cE lOTERS
SECOND OR THIRD FAlORITE AND THEN EeUALLY TORTURED CONCLUSIONS AcOUT WHICH
FILM MIGHT PRElAIL

IN  IT WAS A TOSSUP cETWEEN cOYHOOD AND THE ElENTUAL WINNER cIRDMAN
IN  WITH LOTS OF EhPERTS cETTING ON THE RElENANT OR THE cIG SHORT THE
PRIrE WENT TO SPOTLIGHT LAST YEAR NEARLY ALL THE FORECASTERS DECLARED LA
LA LAND THE PRESUMPTIlE WINNER AND FOR TWO AND A HALF MINUTES THEY WERE
CORRECT cEFORE AN ENlELOPE SNAFU WAS RElEALED AND THE RIGHTFUL WINNER
MOONLIGHT WAS CROWNED

THIS YEAR AWARDS WATCHERS ARE UNEeUALLY DIlIDED cETWEEN THREE cILLcOARDS
OUTSIDE EccING MISSOURI THE FAlORITE AND THE SHAPE OF WATER WHICH IS
THE cAGGERS PREDICTION WITH A FEW FORECASTING A HAIL MARY WIN FOR GET OUT

cUT ALL OF THOSE FILMS HAlE HISTORICAL OSCARlOTING PATTERNS AGAINST THEM THE
SHAPE OF WATER HAS  NOMINATIONS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FILM AND WAS ALSO
NAMED THE YEARS cEST cY THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS GUILDS YET IT WAS NOT
NOMINATED FOR A SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARD FOR cEST ENSEMcLE AND NO FILM HAS
WON cEST PICTURE WITHOUT PRElIOUSLY LANDING AT LEAST THE ACTORS NOMINATION
SINCE cRAlEHEART IN  THIS YEAR THE cEST ENSEMcLE SAG ENDED UP GOING TO

DIRECTOR AND APART FROM ARGO MOlIES THAT LAND cEST PICTURE WITHOUT ALSO
